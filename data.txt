What is HTML?
Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.

The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.
